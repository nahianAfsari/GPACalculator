# GPACalculator
To keep scholarships, I need to maintain a certain GPA. It is impossible for me add every single course from the past 4 semesters and calculate the possibilities of new GPA's. So I am building this program to help me make different kinds of calculations on my GPA to see how my GPA could fluctuate if mess up in classes.
