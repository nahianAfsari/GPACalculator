# GPACalculator

To keep scholarships, I need to maintain a certain GPA. It is impossible for me add every single course from the past 4 semesters and calculate the possibilities of new GPA's. So I am building this program to help me make different kinds of calculations on my GPA to see how my GPA could fluctuate if I mess up in classes.

In the program, I aim to maintain a fast data structure for just storing relevant information in calculating GPA's. I plan to implement algorithms that will calculate specific grades I need to keep up with a certain GPA or make it higher. Users should also be able to test how their GPA's flunctuate if they do bad/well in a class they're currently taking. 

This program will help me decide whether I can afford to mess up a test for a class and work on something else instead. There are many GPA calculators out there but there is no GPA calculator the stores your information so that you can use it again for later use and not input hours and hours of coursework again by hand.

After user is done with the program, I plan to implement some file IO operations where user will have a downloaded copy of the classes with their respective grades they want to keep in the system for future GPA calculations and the program will have a feature where it can read from this special input file generated by the program itself.
